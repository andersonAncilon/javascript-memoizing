# javascript-memoizing
A memoizing class based code, that saves cache of the result in every method call, preventing that the same call with the same params don't be called again, because the result was stored before. 

## Next Steps:
- Implements setInterval to refresh cache based on a X time value;
- Test initialization of cache based on other types (React Context, LocalStorage, etc..)
